# About Me

Hi there! I'm Semasuka Stern, I'm a passionate software engineer with more than 3 years of coding experience, I've graduated from university and a coding bootcamp. I code in Python, Java, Javascript, HTML and CSS. Now, I'm focusing more on machine intelligence (or machine learning) and it's real world-application to solve humankind problems. Myself, I'm learning Machine Learning and the act of writing posts pushes me to explain complex topics in simple words, helping you and also me to gain even a better understanding of Machine Learning, as Albert Einstein said "You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother".

# Why another ML/coding blog?

I promise, this one is different. I've created this blog to help anyone who is interested in Machine Learning and doesn't have a clue where to start. If this sound like you, then you are at the right place I'll start from the beginner level of Machine Learning to more advanced level. If you have some experience, you'll also gain extra knowledge. I'll continually share posts on concepts ranging from maths, programming, data analysis to algorithm optimization used in Machine Learning every week.
