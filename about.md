# About the author

Hi there and Welcome to Machine Intelligence Blog! I'm Stern Semasuka, and I'm a passionate software engineer based in Calgary with more than three years of coding experience. I code in Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Now, I'm learning machine intelligence (or machine learning) and its real world-application to solve humankind challenges. The act of writing posts pushes me to explain complex topics in simple words, helping you, and I gain a better understanding of Machine Learning using the [Feynman Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts).

I firmly believe that ANYONE, with enough commitment and perseverance, can learn and understand Machine Learning and start using it right away to solve challenges and make earth a better place.

# Why another ML/coding blog?

This one is different. This blog helps ANYONE who is interested in Machine Learning but doesn't have a clue where to start because many blogs out there assume that you already have some knowledge.

If this sound like you, then you are at the right place, this blog starts from the beginner level of Machine Learning to more advanced level. If you have some experience, you will also gain new knowledge.

You will learn concepts ranging from programming, maths, data analysis to algorithm optimization and models used in Machine Learning. You will learn these concepts through easy to understand examples.
