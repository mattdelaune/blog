# About the author

Hi there! I'm Semasuka Stern, and I'm a passionate software engineer with more than three years of coding experience. I code in Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Now, I'm focusing more on machine intelligence (or machine learning) and its real world-application to solve humankind challenges. I am learning Machine Learning, and the act of writing posts pushes me to explain complex topics in simple words, helping you, and I gain a better understanding of Machine Learning. I firmly believe that ANYONE, with effort and perseverance, can learn and understand Machine Learning and start using it right away to solve a cause and make earth a better place.

# Why another ML/coding blog?

This one is different. This blog helps ANYONE who is interested in Machine Learning and doesn't have a clue where to start. If this sound like you, then you are at the right place, this blog starts from the beginner level of Machine Learning to more advanced level. If you have some experience, you'll also gain new knowledge. You will learn concepts ranging from programming, maths, data analysis to algorithm optimization and models used in Machine Learning. You will learn these concepts through easy to understand examples.
