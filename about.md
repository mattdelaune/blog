## About the Author

Welcome to The Data Science Experience! I'm Matt Delaune, a SaaS sales Account Executive at RoboMQ. and I'm passionate about using data science to make a real impact, especially in healthcare and biotech. As I shift from software sales to data science, I've realized that writing helps me break down complex ideas into simple, understandable terms—much like the [Feynman Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts).

I genuinely believe that with the right mindset and perseverance, anyone can grasp data science and machine learning, and start applying these tools to solve real-world problems. My goal here is to support you in that journey, every step of the way.

## What Makes This Data Science Blog Different?

This blog is for the curious minds who might feel overwhelmed by the often intimidating world of data science. If you've ever felt lost in the technical jargon or assumed knowledge, this is the place for you.

I’ve designed this blog to be a resource that starts at the very beginning, guiding you through the fundamentals without assuming prior expertise. From the basics of coding and machine learning, including the essential math, to SQL and data analysis, I cover it all. My posts are structured to take you on a learning journey—beginning with the most accessible concepts and gradually moving toward more advanced topics, all through practical, hands-on projects that you can follow at your own pace.
