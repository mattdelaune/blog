    "Hello Folks! Welcome back. In this post, I will discuss the theory behind linear regression models, one of the wildly used machine learning models to predict continuous variables (fancy terms to say that we are predicting a number, also referred to as numerical target or label). The model is quite simple to understand yet powerful. We use it when model interpretability (when we want to know which dependent variables, aka features, are the most predictive) is required, like in the consumer lending or medical fields where transparency is at its core. In the next post, we will dive deeper into the coding part of a Linear Regression."

I used it in the ideation process, brainstorming, and breaking down some of the topics that I needed help understanding (or thought I understood) to come up with more straightforward explanations that everyone without an extensive academic background could easily understand. ChatGPT is a game changer. Sadly, most people in 2023 have yet to realize that. The world of tomorrow belongs to people who will effectively enhance their abilities and knowledge using AI systems. AI is here to stay; we must embrace innovation because no one can stop it or should."

In this post, we will dive deeper and discuss the main ideas about linear regression like sum square root (SSR), mean square error (MSE), R-square, and p-value, and finally, touch a little bit on derivate and gradient descent in regards to linear regression (model optimization). We will demonstrate all these with code in Python in the next blog post. This one is just the theoretical part of it. Let's get started!"

    "Linear regression is part of the linear models family (which assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables). This family also comprises Logistic Regression (I will have a post on this model very soon), Poisson Regression, Probit Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Cox Proportional Hazards Regression. The goal of linear regression is to fit a line (using the best parameter of a straight line, the slope \"m\") to the data that minimizes the loss function or cost function (the difference between the predicted output of a machine learning model and the actual output). The loss function helps us measure how well the model performs given a dataset. The lower the loss function is, the better the model performs. The loss or cost function is also called error or residual. For the rest of this post, I will use error to refer to the loss function."

Rumors say that the country is on the brink of an imminent recession from what the economists say, and the R word is on everyone's lips in the media. Surprisingly, the unemployment number looks very low. Now the president asks you: \"what is the correlation (mutual relationship) between the unemployment rate and consumer spending rate since we know that consumer spending constitutes 70% of our GDP?\". He remembers correctly from the economic class he took in university that as the employment rate increases, we should also expect consumer spending to increase. As more people are employed and have more money to spend, we should not fear a recession. So he is confused and needs some clarification of what is going on."

For example, if we conduct a study involving human health in the medical field, it is best to use a 0.01 threshold to ensure that we minimize false positives as much as possible. On the other side of the spectrum, we are analyzing which communities in the city are consuming more chocolate then a threshold of 0.2 can do just fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to remember is that the p-value does not tell us how different they are. It only just tells us if there is a difference or not. For example, a p-value of 0.71 (71%) is not much different than a p-value of 0.23 (23%) percentage-wise. It tells us that those two p-values are statistically insignificant when the threshold is 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can't discuss the p-value without mentioning the null hypothesis. A null hypothesis is a statement that assumes there is no significant relationship at the beginning of an analysis (it is like a \"default\" position that you start with), meaning that we start the study with the assumption that the P-value < 0.05. After calculating the P-value, we then keep the null hypothesis (when we find no difference) or reject the null hypothesis (when we discover that there is indeed a difference)."

    "As we have seen, Linear regression is one of the simplest Machine Learning model and yet it is very powerful. Depending on the problem that we are trying to solve, this might be what we are actually looking for as simplicity is a desirable model's feature when we wont to understand how a model came up with the result(model interpretability). For example, when a model is used to grant loan for an applicant, we need to understand what independent variable contributed the most into granting or rejecting a loan application. It might be also very useful in the medical field when there is high stake accountability involved. Neural networks might provide better result but might not be the best because of its lack of interpretability. That is why it is commonly referred as black box model."

We have cover almost any theory you need to know about linear regression and I hope you learnt something new as I did when writing this blog. I also discored the power of ChatGPT in terms of improving my productivity while learning and writing. I will certainly use it for my next blog post which will be a handson version of this post where we will dive into the Linear regression using scikit-learn and Python. Really excited about that one so stay tuned!"
