Computers are very good at discovering not immediately apparent patterns within a large dataset (tabular or non-tabular) than most humans. It is called ***data mining***. Data mining is a whole separate computer science discipline on its own. But going back to our question, how do they learn? They learn by breaking the dataset into two datasets. A ***training dataset*** (usually 80% of the dataset) and a ***testing dataset*** (the remaining 20% of the dataset)."

Now imagine for a second, that the lecture decides to give you the exam paper to practice. Probably during the exam time, you will score close to 100% but does that mean that you have learned anything? most definitely you have just crammed the whole exam without really understanding anything. The same does happen to a machine learning model when trained on the testing dataset. It is called ***overfitting*** (We will see more on this later). That is the reason why we need to hide the model from the testing dataset and only train on the training dataset."
