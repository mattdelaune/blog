    "Hello Folks! Welcome back and happy new year as this is the first post in 2023 and certainly not the last. In this post I will discuss about Linear Regression which is one of the wildly used Machine Learning model to predict a continious variables (a fancy terms to say that we are predicting a number, also refered to as numerical target or label). The model is quite simple to understand yet powerful and is used mainly when interpretability of the model (when we want to know which dependent variables aka features are the most predictive) is required like in the consumer lending or medical fields where transparency is at its core."

    "I have briefly discussed about linear regression in [this](https://semasuka.github.io/blog/2021/04/04/demystify-machine-learning.html) post, where we debunking the myth \"Does money buys happiness?\" (spoiler alert, we found out that it actually does) using a simple linear regression model. In this post we will diver deeper, and discuss the main ideas about linear regression like sum square root (SSR), mean square error (MSE), R-square, touch a little bit on derivate and gradient descent in regards to linear regression (model optimization) and finally introduce the p-value at the end. Of course, we will demonstrate all these with code in Python. You know the drill by now! let's get started!"

    "Linear regression is part of linear model family(which assume a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables) which comprised of Logistic Regression (will have a post on this model very soon), Poisson Regression, Probit Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Cox Proportional Hazards Regression. The goal of a linear regression is to fit a line (using the best parameter, the slope \"m\" of a straight line in this case) to the data that minimizes the loss function or cost function (the difference between the predicted output of a machine learning model and the actual output). The loss function helps us to measure how well the model is performing given a dataset. The lower the loss function is, the better the model is performing."

    "Let's use a simple example to illustrate to understand linear regression, let's say you are the president economic advisor of your country. The country is rumored to be on the blink of an imminent recession from what the economist are saying and the R word is on every mouth on the media but surprisingly the unemployment number looks low. Now the president ask you: \"what is the correlation (mutual relationship) between the unemployment rate and the consumer spending since we know that consumer spending constitute 70% of our GDP?\". He remembers correctly from his economic class he took in university, that as the employment rate increases, we should expect consumer spending to increase as well, as more people are employed and have more money to spend we should not fear a recession. So he is confused and needs some clarification"
